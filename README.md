Python Developer Tasks

Task 1:

Read file "data.json", and write a recursive function to convert every value of key "quantity" to 23gm,
50gm and 260gm, presently data is given for 100gm.


Task 2:

Parse "http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/player.cgi?p=<playername>" website to get any player's 
ace percentage, serve point winning percentage and reverse point winning percentage 
(from last 10 matches) using python requests or urllib.


Task 3:

Write a custom random number generation algo which should be 73% biased to the higher number. 
Like if I want ‘a random number between 1 to 10’ 100 times then it should give ‘number more than 5’ 
73 times and ‘less than 5’ 27 times. You’re not allowed to use any predefined random number generation
function nor use of any kind of third party library to generate random number.
